Important Notes for Lab:
When trying to run my code, I was testing the code with just the first couple inputs because I wanted to see if the logic in my merge sort was implemented correctly. When I would only run the first input with a data size of 10. It would give me the correct data but it would also print a lot of garbage data numbers. After using the debugger in VScode I found that the print statement was designed specifically around input 4 which has a data size of 10000. The print array function was designed to print the first and last 100 elements of the merged array but this logic was flawed for any data size less than 200. So to fix this (not sure whether or not this is allowed), I added a conditional statement to use just the data size to print any array smaller than 200 and then for any larger it uses the logic from the original code that prints the first 100 and last 100.
